## :scroll: Description
Kounter can help you count down time from 10 minutes. You can start it, pause it or cancel it at any time you want.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Kounter help me understand how to use jetpack-compose to draw custom view. In this case,
I write a composable to draw circle button and circle counter. I also learn how to manage state
in compose, especially using hoisting.
